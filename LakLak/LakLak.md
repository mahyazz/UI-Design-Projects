## LakLak Co.

LakLak is a mock-startup offering bundles of necessary products and services for expecting and new parents. This e-commerce project consists of two platforms: the main website, for customers, and the suppliers website. The distinction of platforms was achieved by switching the primary and secondary color of the brand color palette.
